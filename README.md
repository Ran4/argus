# argus
Fetches public personal information in natural language from a Wikipedia dump, and stores it in a json-formatted database.

The project is named "Argus" after the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology (additionally, Argus was the name of the builder of the Argonauts' ship - the leader of whom was Jason, a name which is a homophone to the database format the program uses).
